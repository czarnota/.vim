"Clipboard settings
"==================
"
"On Mac OS X and Windows, the * and + registers both point to the system
"clipboard so unnamed and unnamedplus have the same effect: the unnamed
"register is synchronized with the system clipboard.
"On Linux, you have essentially two clipboards: one is pretty much the same as
"in the other OSes (CtrlC and CtrlV in other programs, mapped to register +
"in Vim), the other is the 'selection' clipboard (mapped to register * in Vim).
"Using only unnamedplus on Linux, Windows and Mac OS X allows you to:
"
"   CtrlC in other programs and put in Vim with p on all three platforms,
"   yank in Vim with y and CtrlV in other programs on all three platforms.
"
"If you also want to use Linux's "selection" clipboard, you will also need
"unnamed.
